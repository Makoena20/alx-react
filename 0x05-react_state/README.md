# React State and Lifecycle Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and working with React's state management, lifecycle methods, and hooks. You will also implement concepts like controlled components, lifting state up, and testing state changes using Enzyme.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand and explain the concept of state in React components or containers.
- Comprehend the lifecycle of a React component and where to hook into it.
- Modify and update component state in the correct order using `setState`.
- Work with controlled components and forms in React.
- Lift state up to parent components to manage it in a principal container.
- Create and use React Hooks for handling stateful logic in functional components.
- Test state changes in React components using the Enzyme testing library.

## Project Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Node.js Version**: 12.x.x
- **NPM Version**: 6.x.x
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs, or Visual Studio Code
- **Mandatory File**: `README.md` (this file)
- **All Files**: Ensure every file ends with a new line.

## Project Features

1. **State and Lifecycle**: 
   - Understand the state of a component and how it fits into the React lifecycle.
   
2. **SetState and State Callbacks**: 
   - Use `setState` and handle asynchronous state updates.

3. **Context**: 
   - Use React's Context API to manage and share state across components.

4. **Forms and Controlled Components**: 
   - Create controlled form components in React, handling user input.

5. **Lifting State Up**: 
   - Refactor smaller components and lift state up to parent components when necessary.

6. **React Hooks**: 
   - Use React hooks, like `useState` and `useEffect`, to manage component state.

7. **Enzyme Testing**: 
   - Test state changes and component behavior using Enzyme.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
