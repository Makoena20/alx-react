React Components Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on building React components using both functional and class-based approaches. You will also explore component lifecycles, higher-order components (HOCs), and performance optimization techniques. Testing components with Jest and using the Enzyme library to simulate shallow, mount, and unmount rendering are also key parts of the project.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Differentiate between when to use a class component or a functional component.
Understand the lifecycle methods of a class-based component.
Test React components with Jest and Enzyme.
Utilize Jest spies to verify that functions are called correctly.
Implement Higher-Order Components (HOC) and understand their use cases.
Optimize React performance and manage which components get re-rendered.
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Jest: Testing framework for JavaScript.
Enzyme: Testing utility for React, used to shallow render and simulate components.
Node.js (v12.x.x): JavaScript runtime environment.
npm (v6.x.x): Package manager for JavaScript dependencies.
Requirements
The project must be developed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
Use Node.js version 12.x.x and npm version 6.x.x.
Files must follow specific linting and formatting rules.
All files should end with a new line.
A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project directory.
